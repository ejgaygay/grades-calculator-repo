Repository for my grades calculator and gradebook program

Hello! This grade calculating program/gradebook was created by EJ Gaygay. 

As of now( December 19th, 2020), I am a Freshman at George Mason University currently studying Computer Science. I consider myself a beginner
in coding and this project was made to help me with learning.

This is a side project that I decided to make because I wanted an easier way to manage and calculate my grades. What better way to do so
than by making a program in python that automates this tedious task for me! This program uses text files to accomplish the job. 
Actual files for user friendly viewing are made as well and can be opened by the program itself.

Anyone can use this program as they please.

*INSTRUCTIONS*: 

This program is best used at the start of every semester and to keep up with it.
I highly recommend that you launch this program and add in grades to it once a week.

*DISCLAIMER*:

This program is still a work in progress and so it may still have bugs. 
This program does not have the ability to modify previous grades entered, though I do hope to include 
that feature in the future!
